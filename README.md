A- React- RM
Create a Character Page for Rick and Morty

Using https://rickandmortyapi.com/api to fetch data to display the characters in your own react application.

- Create a new empty repository in GitHub
- Clone the empty repository
- cd into the empty repository and run ```npx create-react-app .```
- Open in Visual Studio Code and start coding!
-Submit Github url to Populi.

Application should:
- Use Fetch to grab data from https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character
- Map through the data and display the first 20 characters from the fetch call (this is automatic since the fetch only has 20 in the results)
- Display should include: Image, name, gender, species and status
- Have at least one more component other than App.js
- Use css or css library like bootstrap to make it look nicer

Stretch:
- Create a next page and previous page button that fetch the next 20 or previous 20 characters.
(Hint: use react state to hold the urls from the response)
Stretch Stretch:
- Click on the card and flip the card over to display the number of episodes the character was in, location and origin.
